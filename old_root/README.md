### Overview
This is the Diffex landing page, the main page you see when you go to www.diffex.io.

Instead of being a react app it is a static site generated using [static-site-boilerpalte](https://staticsiteboilerplate.com/).

Note that all of this is a static site so it only uses html, scss, and JS.
